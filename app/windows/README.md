# Introduction
Some information (such as the motives behind these apps and their benefits) are already outlined in the Android functional requirements. As of such they will not be repeated here. This document will consist of:

* Functional requirements
* Application flow
* Application design

# Functional requirements
The functional requirements describe *what* the application must be capable of and not necessarily *how*. The [Application flow](https://github.com/eduvpn/documentation/blob/master/app/windows/6-APP_FLOW.md) will provide an in depth view on how the application should work.

## Supported operating systems
The application *must* be compatible with Micrsoft's Windows desktop and mobile 8 and higher. Windows 7 is also still being used by our institutions, but developing the eduVPN application for Windows 7 proves to be more troublesome.

## Development

## Publishing

## Additional requirements
* The downloaded VPN configuration and/or other secrets *must* be only stored in protected storage that is only available to the eduvpn application.
* It *must* be possible to manually specify an instance by its URL (in case it is nog listed in instances.json).
* Administrator privileges *must not* be required.
* The license *must* be compatible with OpenVPN for Windows and / or other used components. An exact license needs to be determined, but initially the GPLv3 (or later) *must* be used.

# Application flow
The [application flow](https://github.com/eduvpn/documentation/blob/master/app/windows/6-APP_FLOW.md) describes how the application should work with the API and provides an overview of all the steps within the application.

# Application design
The application design describes the interface, design choices, looks and the user experience.
