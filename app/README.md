# Introduction
The eduVPN and Let's Connect! projects aim to provide native applications for commonly used operating systems such as Android, Windows, MacOS and iOS. Each operating system has its own folder with the following information:

* Functional requirements describes what the application must be capable of (functionality, architecture).
* Technical application flow describes how the application should work (API, steps).
* User application flow shows the flow from a user's perspective.
* Mockup of the user interface shows the design of the UI.
