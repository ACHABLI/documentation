# Two-factor Authentication

The software supports two-factor authentication (2FA) for both authenticating
at the user/admin portal and for connecting to the VPN.

Currently both [YubiKey](https://yubico.com/) and 
[TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm) 
are supported.

By default, 2FA will only be used for authenticating to the user and admin
portals, and not for connecting to the VPN.

## Enrollment

Users can enroll themselves in the portal on the "Account" page. If the user
is enrolled for 2FA, and has access to the admin portal, it will also be used
there.

The documentation page in the user portal gives more information about 2FA and
how to use it.

**NOTE**: currently a user can enroll for both YubiKey and TOTP 2FA. The 2FA 
method can be "upgraded" to YubiKey at any time, which may be a security risk,
see this [issue](https://github.com/eduvpn/vpn-user-portal/issues/60).

## Enabling 2FA for VPN connections

Assuming your profile is `internet`, you need to modify 
`/etc/vpn-server-api/default/config.php`:

    'vpnProfiles' => [
        'internet' => [
            'profileNumber' => 1,
            'displayName' => 'Internet Access',
            ...
            ...
            'twoFactor' => true,
        ],
    ],

Now the server configuration needs to be regenerated:

    $ sudo vpn-server-node-server-config --profile internet

Also, the VPN processes need to be restarted:

    $ sudo systemctl restart "openvpn-server@default-internet-*"

## Connecting to the VPN

Users will need to provide their OTP key also when authenticating to the
VPN. The client will ask for a user name and password. The user name MUST be
`totp` and as password the 6 digit code generated by the OTP application, or
`yubi` and the code generated by the YubiKey when pressing its button.

For example on Windows:

## Recovery

If a user lost their second factor credentials, they can be removed through 
the "admin".

If an administrator is enrolled for OTP, is the only administrator and loses 
their secret, the enrollment can be cancelled removing the OTP enrollment in
the DB. Assuming the user ID is `foo`, do the following:

    $ sudo sqlite3 /var/lib/vpn-server-api/default/db.sqlite

Perform the following query:

    UPDATE users SET totp_secret=NULL, yubi_key_id=NULL WHERE user_id='foo'
