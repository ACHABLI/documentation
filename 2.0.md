# 2.0 

These are some ideas for a 2.0 release of the VPN code.

* merge `vpn-user-portal`, `vpn-admin-portal` and `vpn-server-api` to simplify
  architecture;
  * simplifies install and removes the need for extensive internal/private 
    API;
* no longer support "multi instance" deploys
  * too complicated (security risks!);
  * no IPv6 (outer tunnel) support in these kinds of deploys;
* get rid of `info.json` and instead use convention over configuration;
