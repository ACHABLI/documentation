This page will describe how to configure Windows with OpenVPN. We will focus 
on the official OpenVPN client for Windows. It can be downloaded 
[here](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html).

Excellent instructions on how to install OpenVPN for Windows can
be found [here](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/OpenVPN-GUI).

One this is important: You need to put the `ovpn` configuration file you 
download in the folder `C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config`;

Now when you double click "OpenVPN GUI" it will start. You can start the VPN 
connection by right clicking on the OpenVPN tray icon and clicking "Connect".
