# Introduction

## Boostrap

The Bootstrap CSS is generated using 
[Bootstrap Customize](https://getbootstrap.com/customize/) with the 
`config.json` from the `bootstrap` folder. The ZIP file you can then download 
is extracted and the `bootstrap.min.css` is taken from it.

Even with all the cruft removed by the customizer it is still 60kB minified, 
but well, for now good enough.

## Logo

The logo, if there is ever a new one, is 'crushed' with 
[pngcrush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pngcrush) to reduce its size 
(losslessly).
