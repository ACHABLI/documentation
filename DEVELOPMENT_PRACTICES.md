**NOTE**: this is a work in progress!

# Introduction

This post will describe my personal development practices for 
[PHP](https://secure.php.net/) software development running in production on 
[CentOS](https://centos.org/) and 
[Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux).
 
It will be long, contain a lot of details and hopefully this will be useful for
your own projects!

These practices slowly "evolved" while developing [eduVPN](https://eduvpn.org/) 
and [Let's Connect](https://letsconnect-vpn.org/). These are projects sharing
the same code base that can be used to run your own managed VPN service. The 
code can be found [here](https://github.com/eduVPN/).

This document will describe the tools I use, why I use them, why I do not use
some popular tools and how I achieve (hopefully) high quality code without 
relying exclusively on proprietary tools and "cloud" services.

We will walk through development by creating a library, 
[yubitwee](https://github.com/fkooman/php-yubitwee), and a web application, 
[yubicheck](https://github.com/fkooman/yubicheck), to demonstrate the 
development practices from development to deployment.

# Principles

As I need to write code that runs on CentOS, I need to target PHP 5.4. This 
EOLed version of PHP is maintained by Red Hat, which means I will rely on 
them to fix (critical) security problems in PHP and the rest of the OS. I'm 
doing all development and testing initially on the latest release of 
[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), which typically includes the latest version 
of PHP, at this time of writing PHP 7.1. This means, my code will run on all 
PHP versions >= 5.4.

Unfortunatly targeting PHP 5.4 rules out a number of useful libraries, for 
example the OAuth 2.0 
[client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client) and 
[server](http://oauth2.thephpleague.com/) libraries of 
[The League of Extraordinary Packages](http://thephpleague.com/). However, this 
opens the door for writing minimal libraries that only do what is needed and
nothing more.

Talking about using dependencies, these are my general rules I try to follow as
much as possible. I have these rules to make sure they actually work, reduce 
the amount of code, guarantee high quality, all for the benefit of security 
and easy maintainability of the code:

- Supports PHP 5.4;
- Do not use frameworks (see below);
- Minimize the number of dependencies (and dependencies of dependencies) as 
  much as possible;
- Only use high quality, stable, small libraries that follow 
  [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/);
- Prefer dependencies that are already properly packaged in 
  CentOS/[EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL);

So whenever I write something and think I can use a dependency for certain 
functionality, I check the distribution's package repository to see if there is 
already a package available that provides that functionality. If not, I search 
for the most popular, simplest library that takes care of my needs, usually 
through the amazing [Packagist](https://packagist.org/). If it does 
not exist, all available options are too complicated/bloated, or targets PHP 
versions > 5.4, I write my own and try to write a minimally functional library 
with extensive testing included. 

If the software is of use outside the VPN project I release it as free 
software and submit a package request once the software stabilizes to have it 
included in the distribution(s). Luckily, CentOS/EPEL contains already a large 
number of high quality dependencies!

Some dependencies that made the cut, i.e. followed the principles mentioned 
above:

- [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/), a PHP template engine;
- [Symfony PHP polyfills](https://github.com/symfony/polyfill), to make 
  functionality from PHP versions > 5.4 available in 5.4;
- [Constant-Time Character Encoding in PHP Projects](https://github.com/paragonie/constant_time_encoding); 
- [QR codes](https://github.com/Bacon/BaconQrCode);
- [OTP](https://github.com/ChristianRiesen/otp); 

Some already widely used and available dependencies that I found through e.g. 
Packagist, that did not follow my principles, for which I wrote my own 
versions:

- [Secure Cookie and Session library for PHP](https://github.com/fkooman/php-secookie);
- [YubiKey Validator](https://github.com/fkooman/php-yubitwee);
- [Very simple OAuth 2.0 client](https://github.com/fkooman/php-oauth2-client);
- [Very simple OAuth 2.0 server](https://github.com/fkooman/php-oauth2-server);

The rationale for creating each of those libraries is described in the their 
accompanying `README.md` file.

## Frameworks

**XXX: this section is still pretty weak, could be better!**

There are a number of reasons not to use (popular) frameworks in the software. 
Most, like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) or 
[Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/) target newer versions of PHP which rules 
them out. Technically, older versions of [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) would 
be an option, it is even packaged for Fedora and EPEL. To sum up the main 
reasons for not using a framework: 

* Does not support PHP 5.4;
* Solves way too much;
* We do not want to implement REST at all;
* No interest in having extensive database migration/update support and object
  mapping;
* No interest in chasing framework updates;

See the excellent [PHP - The Wrong Way](http://www.phpthewrongway.com/) for 
more critique on frameworks and common dogmatic approaches to software 
development.

# Tools

As a general rule here, I only use free software tools. Furthermore, I try to 
limit the dependency on external services as much as possible, and if they are
used, have a migration path to move away from them if needed. This mostly 
applies to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

This also applies to services like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) and 
[Scrutinizer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/). I started out using them when the 
project started, but it turned out there are now a number of high quality 
(locally running) tools available that accomplish the same, or even perform 
better.

I do not use an IDE, I really tried 
[PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), but it is too heavy for my 
taste and does a lot of stuff I do not want it to do. Recently I quickly 
evaluated [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which doesn't 
seem that bad, but I quickly forgot it and turned back to my favorite editors. 
I use [gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit) which is a simple editor for 
[GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/). The following is a list of tools I regularly 
use for development:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/), for version control;
- [composer](https://getcomposer.org/), for PHP dependency management;
- [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan), for static code analysis;
- [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPhp/PHP-CS-Fixer), for source code 
  formatting;
- [Psalm](https://getpsalm.org/), static analysis tool for PHP;
- [PHPMD](https://phpmd.org/) to view the mess I made;
- [PHP_CompatInfo](http://php5.laurent-laville.org/compatinfo/), to determine 
  PHP version requirements and PHP extensions used by the code;
- [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/), to run unit tests;

## Travis CI

I feel I need to explain why I'm not using Travis CI (anymore). The main reason
is that running tests of the code on Travis CI does not actually test in the 
environment the code will be actually deployed on. I'm deploying on CentOS 7, 
not on Ubuntu with a custom compiled PHP binary without for example a PECL 
extensions I use a lot, 
[libsodium](https://www.gitbook.com/book/jedisct1/libsodium/details) that 
requires too much fiddling to get working. Of course you could work around this 
by using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) inside Travis CI to actually test on
CentOS 7, but why bother? I can easily run those same tests using 
[Mock](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki), but more on that 
later!

## Tool Installation

To install all the tools mentioned above and set up your Fedora development 
machine:

    $ sudo dnf -y install fedora-packager git composer php-cs-fixer \
        php-phpmd-PHP-PMD php-bartlett-PHP-CompatInfo php-phpunit-PHPUnit \
        php-pecl-xdebug yum-utils nosync

As PHPStan and Psalm do not (yet) have a package for Fedora, we install it 
"globally" for the current user:

    $ composer global require phpstan/phpstan
    $ composer global require vimeo/psalm

Add the following to `$HOME/.bash_profile` just before the `export PATH`: 

    PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin

Log out and in again to activate the new path. Now you should be able to use
`phpstan` and `psalm` directly from the terminal.

# Development

As mentioned above, we'll create two projects: 

* [yubitwee](https://github.com/fkooman/php-yubitwee) - YubiKey OTP Validator 
  library
* [yubicheck](https://github.com/fkooman/yubicheck) - YubiKey OTP Validator 
  web application

We choose these two because they show the two different kinds of packages we 
will create. They differ somewhat, so it makes sense to address both types.

## Library

The library was already developed before writing this document, so we will not
get into details here, but focus on the packaging here. You can see the link
above to see the source code and the folder structure.

## Web Application

    $ mkdir -p $HOME/Projects/yubicheck
    $ cd ${HOME}/Projects/yubicheck
    $ mkdir src web tests
    $ composer init

Regarding dependencies, you need to use `fkooman/yubitwee` as a `require` 
dependency, and `phpunit/phpunit` as a `require-dev`:

    $ composer init
    Package name (<vendor>/<name>) [fkooman/yubicheck]: 
    Description []: A simple YubiKey OTP checker for the Web
    Author [Fran√ßois Kooman <fkooman@tuxed.net>, n to skip]: 
    Minimum Stability []: 
    Package Type (e.g. library, project, metapackage, composer-plugin) []: project
    License []: MIT

    Define your dependencies.

    Would you like to define your dependencies (require) interactively [yes]? 
    Search for a package: fkooman/yubitwee
    Enter the version constraint to require (or leave blank to use the latest version): ^1
    Search for a package: 
    Would you like to define your dev dependencies (require-dev) interactively [yes]? 
    Search for a package: phpunit/phpunit
    Enter the version constraint to require (or leave blank to use the latest version): ^5
    Search for a package: 

    {
        "name": "fkooman/yubicheck",
        "description": "A simple YubiKey OTP checker for the Web",
        "type": "project",
        "require": {
            "fkooman/yubitwee": "^1"
        },
        "require-dev": {
            "phpunit/phpunit": "^5"
        },
        "license": "MIT",
        "authors": [
            {
                "name": "Fran√ßois Kooman",
                "email": "fkooman@tuxed.net"
            }
        ]
    }

    Do you confirm generation [yes]? 

It is also required to add information about the classes we are about to create 
for the autoloader to work:

    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "fkooman\\YubiCheck\\": "src/",
            "fkooman\\YubiCheck\\Tests\\": "tests/"
        }
    },

Now you can run `composer update` to fetch all dependencies and generate the 
autoloader.

## Tests

Running tests can be done with PHPUnit:

    $ phpunit tests --verbose --color

To also perform code coverage analysis, this will create a HTML report in the
`coverage/` folder:

    $ phpunit tests --verbose --color --whitelist src --coverage-html coverage

## Code Analysis

PHPMD:

    $ phpmd "src,web,tests" text "cleancode,codesize,controversial,design,naming,unusedcode"

PHPStan:

    $ phpstan analyse -l 7 src web tests

Psalm:

    $ psalm --init
    $ psalm

A useful option is `--update-docblocks` to automatically at return types to 
"docblocks", especially useful for adding `@return void`.

## Source Formatting

In order to "fix" the source code according to source code standards, e.g. 
[PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/), 
[PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) and 
[Symfony](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html) 
standards I use PHP-CS-Fixer.

Run the source formatting:

    $ php-cs-fixer fix . --rules=@Symfony

There are many more rules to fix things, but this is a safe start. The extra 
rules I use at the moment:

* `ordered_imports`;
* `array_syntax`;
* `ordered_class_elements`.

They are all described in the PHP-CS-Fixer documentation, as is a way to create
a configuration file that you can store in your repository.

## Finding Dependencies

In order to make sure you target the right version of PHP, and found all 
dependencies on PHP extensions you use in your code, it is important
to use PHP_CompatInfo.

    $ phpcompatinfo analyser:run src

Here `src` is the directory to check, you may also want to check the `bin`, 
`tests` and `web` directories. It does not seem possible to specify multiple
paths at the same time.

At the bottom of the report you'll see something like this:

    Requires PHP 5.4.0 (min), PHP 5.4.0 (all)

This indicates PHP 5.4 is required, which is good! Near the top you'll find 
`Extensions Analysis` which lists the extensions of PHP that we use in the 
code, in the case of [YubiTwee](https://github.com/fkooman/php-yubitwee/) that
is the following:

    Core              Core     5.1.0       5.1.0
    curl              curl     5.1.3       5.1.3
    date              date     5.2.0       5.2.0
    hash              hash     1.1         4.0.0
    pcre              pcre     4.0.0       4.0.0
    spl               spl      5.1.0       5.1.0
    standard          standard 4.0.7       4.0.7

All of them, except `Core` and `standard` can be added to the `composer.json` 
to tell Composer that those PHP extensions are required. The output can be a 
bit tricky, in this instance the list of extensions misses the dependency on 
`libsodium`. In some instances, when using 
[PDO](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) for connecting to 
databases that extension, `pdo` may also be missed! So it makes sense to look 
through the report carefully and make sure you didn't miss anything. If you
find the dependencies in the `bin`, `src` or `web` folders you add them to the
`require` section of `composer.json`, if you only find them in the `tests` 
folder you add them to the `require-dev` section. So, for YubiTwee the 
`require` section in `composer.json` looks like this:

    "require": {
        "ext-curl": "*",
        "ext-date": "*",
        "ext-hash": "*",
        "ext-libsodium": "*",
        "ext-pcre": "*",
        "ext-spl": "*",
        "paragonie/constant_time_encoding": "^1|^2",
        "php": ">=5.4"
    }

# Packaging

Next up is packaging. Of course you could run `composer install` in your 
application directory and package the whole thing up, call it "DevOps" and make
deploying it someone else's problem. Or maybe even your own. Why not make it 
easy by packaging the software? That way you get the same benefits as all other
software packaged in the distribution you deploy on, mostly meaning easy of 
installation and update of the software and its components, maybe even only 
a small component.

Packaging PHP libraries and applications is actually pretty straight forward, 
as you only put the PHP files on this disk, no need to compile anything. The 
only thing you have to deal with is the PHP autoloader. Composer is not used 
for packaging, so there is no automatically generated autoloader anymore. 
Luckily there is a very simple 
[autoloader](https://github.com/php-fedora/autoloader) project that is being 
used in CentOS/EPEL and Fedora for this very purpose.

We'll create a YubiKey validator application that just accepts a YubiKey OTP 
and asks the YubiCo servers to validate it. It depends on a library that we 
will also package to show the complete flow.

### Creating a Package

We need to create two packages, one for 
[fkooman/yubitwee](https://github.com/fkooman/php-yubitwee) and one for 
[yubicheck](https://github.com/fkooman/yubicheck).

To create a "template" `spec` file, the file that describes how to create the
package do the following:

    $ rpmdev-setuptree

### Library

Libraries get named after their Composer name, typically they contains the 
"vendor" and the name of the library". In case of YubiTwee, the vendor is 
`fkooman` and the library name is `yubitwee`. In that case, the name of the 
RPM package becomes `php-fkooman-yubitwee`. 

    $ cd ${HOME}/rpmbuild/SPECS
    $ rpmdev-newspec php-fkooman-yubitwee

* rpmdev-bumpspec
* git commit from git log 
* release   0.1%{?dist}  for prereleases
* (build)requires from `composer.json`

The `php-fkooman-yubitwee.spec` file you end up with:

    %global commit0 bf8e5f1106b11a3f50b1113d3db6609294a488da

### Building
    
The next command will fetch the source code:

    $ spectool -g -R yubicheck.spec

Building the source RPM:

    $ rpmbuild -bs yubicheck.spec

Building the binary RPM:

    $ rpmbuild -bb yubicheck.spec

### Checking Packages

The `rpmlint` tool can be used to verify the spec-file, the source RPM and the 
package RPM:

    $ rpmlint \
        ${HOME}/rpmbuild/SPECS/yubicheck.spec \
        ${HOME}/rpmbuild/SRPMS/yubicheck-1.0.0-1.fc26.src.rpm \
        ${HOME}/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/yubicheck-1.0.0-1.fc26.noarch.rpm

### Mock

XXX add user to group mock

In order to make sure the package also builds on a clean installation, e.g. 
all required dependencies are installed it is important to build the package,
*and* run the tests on a clean system. The tool to use for that is
[Mock](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki).

To enable "Nosync" to speed up builds a great deal:

    $ echo "config_opts['nosync'] = True" >> ${HOME}/.config/mock.cfg

To use Mock, you first need to generate the source RPM, as shown above and 
then call Mock:

    $ mock ${HOME}/rpmbuild/SRPMS/yubicheck-1.0.0-1.fc26.src.rpm

To build for CentOS/Red Hat 7, we need to pass the `--yum` flag here 
additionally, it also needs the `yum-utils` package installed:

    $ mock -r epel-7-x86_64 --yum ${HOME}/rpmbuild/SRPMS/yubicheck-1.0.0-1.fc26.src.rpm

This will build the RPMs from scratch, and will also run the unit tests. Now 
you have a package for both CentOS and Fedora.

### Mockchain

If you have multiple packages, and they depend on each other, you need to use
`mockchain` to make this work. Specify the source RPMs in the build order, so 
first the dependencies and then the packages depending on them!

    $ mockchain -r fedora-26-x86_64 /home/fkooman/rpmbuild/SRPMS/php-fkooman-yubitwee-1.0.1-1.fc26.src.rpm /home/fkooman/rpmbuild/SRPMS/yubicheck-1.0.0-1.fc26.src.rpm

For CentOS, `-m --yum` is needed here:

    $ mockchain -r epel-7-x86_64 -m --yum /home/fkooman/rpmbuild/SRPMS/php-fkooman-yubitwee-1.0.1-1.fc26.src.rpm /home/fkooman/rpmbuild/SRPMS/yubicheck-1.0.0-1.fc26.src.rpm

## Deployment

These steps are performed on the server you want to deploy the code on!

### PHP

    $ sudo yum -y install php-fpm httpd

Modern PHP is deployed using PHP-FPM and not `mod_php` anymore. To make things
work the same as on Fedora we use a `php.conf` file that's part of the 
`php-fpm` package in Fedora. It can be found 
[here](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/php/blob/master/f/php.conf). Put this
in `/etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf`.

The default PHP-FPM configuration on CentOS does not use a socket, but listens
on the network, modify this as well:

    $ sudo sed -i "s|^listen = 127.0.0.1:9000$|listen = /run/php-fpm/www.sock|" /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf

Make everything start on boot:

    $ systemctl enable httpd
    $ systemctl enable php-fpm
    $ systemctl restart httpd
    $ systemctl restart php-fpm

### Installation

You can copy the created RPM file now to the server and install it. Restart 
Apache again and you should be good to go!
