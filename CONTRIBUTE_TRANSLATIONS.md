If you'd like to contribute translations to the VPN software this document
explains how.

# Server

You can check which translations are already available, and possibly update 
them if they are out of date:

* [vpn-user-portal](https://github.com/eduvpn/vpn-user-portal/tree/master/locale)

The files use the PHP 
[Array](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php) syntax.

The "key" is the English string, the value should be the translation. 
# Apps

TBD.

# Submitting

Once you are done, you can submit your translation file either by creating a 
"Pull Request" on GitHub, or simply mailing the file with your translations to
[eduvpn-support@lists.geant.org](mailto:eduvpn-support@lists.geant.org).

Thanks!
