If you'd like to contribute translations to the VPN software this document
explains how.

# Tools

It is easiest to use [Poedit](https://poedit.net/download), available for many 
operating systems. We prefer free software tools you can use "offline" over 
[SaaSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html).

However, if you prefer to use an "online" service they can typically import and
export "po" files.

# Server

You can check which translations are already available, and possibly update 
them if they are out of date:

* [vpn-user-portal](https://github.com/eduvpn/vpn-user-portal/tree/master/locale)
* [vpn-admin-portal](https://github.com/eduvpn/vpn-admin-portal/tree/master/locale)

## User Portal

You can download the "po" file 
[here](https://github.com/eduvpn/vpn-user-portal/raw/master/locale/VpnUserPortal.po). 
Open it is Poedit, set the language and start translating! :)

## Admin Portal

You can download the "po" file 
[here](https://github.com/eduvpn/vpn-admin-portal/raw/master/locale/VpnAdminPortal.po). 
Open it is Poedit, set the language and start translating! :)

# Apps

TBD.

# Submitting

Once you are done, you can submit your translation file either by creating a 
"Pull Request" on GitHub, or simply mailing the file with your translations to
[eduvpn@surfnet.nl](mailto:eduvpn@surfnet.nl).

Thanks!
